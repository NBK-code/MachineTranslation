# Machine Translation

## Dataset

We use the Anki deu-eng language dataset from http://www.manythings.org/anki/. This dataset consists of over 200,000 pairs of sentences in English and German.

## Translation Models

We perform machine translation from English to German using two models:
1. A Recurrent Neural Network model (LSTMs)
2. A Transformer model
